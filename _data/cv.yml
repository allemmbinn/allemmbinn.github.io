        year: "May 2024 - Present"
        description:
          - Guided by Dr. Abdalla Swikir to work on 'Learning Barrier Certified Neural Network Dynamical Systems for Robot Motion Planning'
          - Reduced MSE by ~5% by leveraging neural networks to learn unknown dynamical systems (DS) from reference data to avoid obstacles
          - Implemented the algorithm to learn 3 regression-based neural networks simultaneously on Pytorch and ensured SMT verification
          - Enhanced computational efficiency by ~200% by using compositional methods to learn the DS using Linear Parameter Varying methods
          - Established real-world applications by testing on a 7-DOF robotic manipulator (Franka Emika Panda) using C++ and Python
