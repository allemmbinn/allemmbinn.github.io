<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I am a junior at Indian Institue of Technology Kharagpur. I am a robotics and controls enthusiast. I am also the Governor of the Debating Society at IIT Kharagpur.

Currently I'm working with [Prof Pushpak Jagtap](https://www.pushpakjagtap.com/) at the [Focas Lab](https://www.focaslab.com/) at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) currently working on the F1Tenth vehicle.

My hobbies are debating and dramatics. If you are interested in robotics and would like to discuss anything do drop a mail!
